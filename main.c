/*key is an int
This cipher can be described mathematically using the modulus operator. The “key” is an integer, k,
between -25 and 25 (0 and 26 imply ”no encryption”) and each letter is allocated a number:
a = 0, b = 1, c = 2, ..., z = 25.
Encryption can then be performed on a message letter, m, by defining the encryption function, e(m), as:
e(x) = (m + k)(mod 26)
where “mod” means the modulus operator (% symbol in C).
The decryption of a cipher text letter, c, can be defined by a decryption function, d(c), as follows:
d(c) = (c − k)(mod 26)*/
